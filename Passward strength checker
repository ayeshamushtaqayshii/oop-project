A Password Strength Checker is a security-based program designed to evaluate the quality and strength of a user’s password.
It helps users create secure passwords by checking whether the entered password follows specific security rules.

The system analyzes the password based on factors such as:

Minimum length requirement
Presence of uppercase letters
Presence of lowercase letters
Inclusion of numeric digits
Use of special characters

If the password does not meet these criteria, the program identifies the weaknesses and guides the user by showing what is missing. 
The user is then asked to improve the password until it becomes strong enough.

Purpose of Password Strength Checker

The main purpose of a password strength checker is to:

Improve account security
Prevent weak and easily guessable passwords
Reduce the risk of unauthorized access
Educate users about strong password practices

Features

Validates password length
Checks for character diversity

Importance

Weak passwords are one of the most common causes of security breaches.
A password strength checker ensures that users create passwords that are hard to guess and resistant to attacks, thereby increasing overall system security.
